However, if you still wish to allow direct root access with a password, you can edit the SSH configuration file as follows:

Log in to your server using SSH as a user with sudo privileges.

1.Open the SSH configuration file using a text editor such as nano or vi:

#sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

2.Find the following line:

#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password

Replace it with the following line:

PermitRootLogin yes

Save and close the file.

Restart the SSH service to apply the changes:

#sudo service ssh restart
